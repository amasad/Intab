Intab
=====
Quick Look For Your Browser

I've never open sourced a project before, so forgive me if I have no idea what I'm doing.

Want to contribute? There's a lot to do. A quick list of the top of my head:

* Google selection using Intab (in progress)
* Read Later support (Pocket, Instapaper, Readability)
* Buffer support (?)
* Function to have Intab takeover parent window
* Allow dragging open Intab after .peak()
* Firefox version
* Safari version
